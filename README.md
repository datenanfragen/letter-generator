# Letter Generator 

> This repository contains the source code for Letters Generation (plain text or PDF) from templates  

## Installation

You can install this tools via `yarn`:  

```sh
yarn add letter-generator
```

## Usage  

### 1 - Create a template

You can use a template to generate your text with variables and flags 

```js
// The text contains the static text, flags and variables
// The flags should follow this form: [flag_name>The text contained in the flag]
// The variables should follow this form: {variable_name}
const templateText = "Here is a wonderful template [flag_1>I don't want this to be printed out] \n Checkout the {webpage} website! \n[flag_2>I want this to be printed out]";

// You should map the flag_name used in the template text with their visibilities (Boolean)
const flags = { flag_1: false, flag_2: true };

// You should map the variable_name used in the template text with their values
const variables = {webpage: 'datenanfragen.de'};

// Create the template from our values and generate the output text as string
const template = new Template(templateText, flags, variables);
const content = template.getText();
```

### 2 - Creating a Letter

You'll have to pass an object to the letter constructor containing those informations:  

```js
const props = {
    // The sender address, either as a string or as an array of the individual lines.
    sender_address: ['Jane Doe', '123 Some Lane', '12345 Some City', 'Some Country'],

    // The recipient address, individual or array
    recipient_address: ['John Doe', '667 One Street', '98765 Another City', 'A Country'],  

    // The information block usually displayed at the top-right of the letter. Can either be a string, a string[] or anything recognized by pdfmake.
    information_block: 'A block of information',

    // The Letter subject
    // In this case we use the text generated with the template but you can use a string
    subject: content,

    // The content of the letter. Can either be a string or anything recognized by pdfmake.
    content: 'Content of my letter',

    // OPTIONAL
    // The signature to be included after the content.
    signature: { type: 'text', name: 'Name' } // To just add the name
        //{ type: 'image', name: 'Name', value: '<BASE64 ENCODED IMAGE>'} to include an image with the name underneath
}
```

### 3 - Rendering the Letter

You can now create the letter object and use it:  
The default layout is the [DIN 5008-a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_5008) layout  

```js
// Use default layout
const letter = new Letter(props);

// You can also give the letter a function that returns a pdfmake layout as second parameter:
const letter_with_layout = new Letter(props, layout_function);
```

Once your Letter is generated you can create a PdfRender from it:

```js
const render = new PdfRenderer(letter);
render.triggerOpenInNewWindow();
render.triggerDownload();
```
